## Program walk-through:
<b>Launch Program:</b> 
 The program can be launched by simply downloading the program file (div_calc_1.py) and running it through your cmd (assuming path variables are set correctly and you are in the correct directory) or any IDE.

<b>Step 1:</b>  
The program will ask you to input the number of assets you want in your portfolio, how many years you would like to invest, and how much money you plan to put toward your monthly investments.
